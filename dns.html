   The domain name system a DNS is hierarchal are a flow chart to the presentation and decentralization naming system for devices like usual wires and services when no other resources are connected to Internet or any private network. It associates lots of information including domain name given to each of the member further more prominently,It can also translate domain name into IEPâ€™s which are numerical for locating and tracking various services and devices that are underlying network protocol.Hands by granting a global distributed service the domain name system is also crucial for functional functioning or web services since the late 1980s.</p><p class="lead">

    It also delegates the responsibleness ofThe part when it comes to assign domain names and map them to various online resources by authoritatively designating name servers in each one of the two mean hands network administration me also delegate their authority over following sub domains of their allocated name to various remote servers.And so this mechanism helps providing fall tolerant and so-called distributed services and it was designated merely to avoid having a single large database.</p><p class="lead">

    The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.</p><p class="lead">

The Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy[1] and the Internet Protocol (IP) address spaces.[2] The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.</p><p class="lead">

The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam) by storing a real-time blackhole list (RBL). The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the zone file, but other database systems are common.
